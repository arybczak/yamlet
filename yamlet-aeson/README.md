# yamlet-aeson

Use the `FromJSON` and `ToJSON` instances of
[aeson](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson) with
[yamlet](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/yamlet), for the types that have
no `FromYaml` and `ToYaml` instances yet, e.g. in a program that moves from
the yaml package to yamlet.

- A value in `ViaAeson` decodes and encodes with its `FromJSON` and `ToJSON`
  instances, so the functions of yamlet work with it, e.g.
  `decodeFile @(ViaAeson Config)`. A program can try yamlet by changing only
  the places that decode and encode.
- A type with `FromJSON` and `ToJSON` instances can derive its `FromYaml` and
  `ToYaml` instances via `ViaAeson`, e.g. in a program that reads and writes
  both JSON and YAML and keeps one set of instances.
- An error of a decoder of aeson points to the node that caused it, with the
  line, the column and the path. An error of a key of a map points to the
  value of the key, and its path names the key.
- The encoder keeps the order of the fields of a type whose instance defines
  `toEncoding`, e.g. with `genericToEncoding`.
- The package also has the `FromYaml` and `ToYaml` instances for the `Value`
  of aeson.

A program that uses the yaml package can switch to yamlet in steps with this
package. The document
[Coming from the yaml package](https://github.com/arybczak/yamlet/blob/master/docs/coming-from-yaml.md)
shows how, and lists the differences between the two.

## Example

A list of servers decodes with the `FromJSON` instance of the server type.
Each server decodes on its own, so an error in one server does not hide the
errors in the others:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE GHC2021 #-}
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveAnyClass #-}
{-# LANGUAGE DerivingStrategies #-}
{-# LANGUAGE NoFieldSelectors #-}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedRecordDot #-}

import Data.Aeson qualified as A
import Data.Text (Text)
import Yamlet
import Yamlet.Aeson

data Server = Server {port :: Int, host :: Text}
  deriving stock (Generic, Show)
  deriving anyclass (A.FromJSON)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  result <- decodeFile @[ViaAeson Server] path
  case result of
    Left errs -> mapM_ (putStrLn . prettyError path) errs
    Right servers -> mapM_ (print . (.value)) servers
  where
    path :: FilePath
    path = "servers.yaml"
```

For this file:

```yaml
- port: 80
  host: a.example.com
- port: 81
  host: b.example.com
```

the program prints the servers:

```
Server {port = 80, host = "a.example.com"}
Server {port = 81, host = "b.example.com"}
```

For this file:

```yaml
- port: http
  host: a.example.com
- port: 81
- port: 82
  host: c.example.com
```

the program prints every error:

```
servers.yaml:1:9: [0].port: parsing Int failed, expected Number, but encountered String
  |
1 | - port: http
  |         ^
servers.yaml:3:3: [1]: parsing Main.Server(Server) failed, key "host" not found
  |
3 | - port: 81
  |   ^
```

## Order of keys

The encoder writes the keys of a mapping in the order of `toEncoding`. The
default `toEncoding` goes through `toJSON`, so the keys come in the order of
an aeson object, which is sorted by default.

The decoder of aeson gets the keys in no order, because an aeson object has
none. To keep the order of a mapping, a program decodes the mapping with a
decoder of yamlet, e.g. with `withMapping` and `objectEntries`. Its values
can still decode via `ViaAeson`.

## Conversion

A YAML document converts to an aeson `Value` as follows:

- A key is the text of its scalar, e.g. `"0x10"` for `0x10` and `"~"` for
  `~`, as in the yaml package. Two keys with the same text are an error,
  e.g. `1` and `"1"`. A key that is a collection is an error.
- A key `<<` is an ordinary key, because the merge keys of YAML 1.1 are
  not supported.
- `.inf` and `-.inf` are the strings `"+inf"` and `"-inf"`, and `.nan` is
  null, which the `FromJSON` and `ToJSON` instances for `Double` and `Float`
  read and write.
- `-0.0` is the number 0, because a `Scientific` has no negative zero.
- A number whose exponent in scientific notation is beyond the range
  from -1000 to 1000, e.g. `1e1001`, is an error, as in yamlet. A `Number`
  with such an exponent converts to YAML, but does not read back, e.g.
  `1e1025` and `1e-1001`. The exception is a number that aeson writes in
  JSON as an integer, i.e. one whose `base10Exponent` is from 0 to 1024,
  e.g. `1e1001`. It converts to an integer, which reads back.
- A tag that is not of the core schema makes a scalar a string, e.g.
  `!secret 123` is the string `"123"`. The yaml package reads it as the
  number 123. A collection with such a tag converts as without it, e.g.
  `!point {x: 1}` is the object `{"x": 1}`.

A `FromJSON` instance can convert two different keys to the same key and then
keep only one of the pairs, as it does for JSON, e.g. `1` and `1.0` for a
`Map Int`. The `FromYaml` instances for maps reject such keys.

A `Value` converts to YAML as aeson writes it in JSON, e.g. the keys of a
`Map Int` are strings, which the encoder quotes because they look like
numbers.
